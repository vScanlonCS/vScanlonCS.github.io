            <p>The Island I Remember</p>
          </center>
          <p>I don’t remember my first visits to Governor’s Island. I don’t know how old I was, what the weather was like, or anything like that. It’s been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. As far back as I can see, it’s always been there, a staple of long summer days spent with my father before I had anything to worry about, any summer reading to do.</p>
          <p>The way I remember it, it’s nothing like how it is now. Nowadays, it’s much more popular– the long-awaited construction projects have finally finished, and the island boasts many new exhibitions to draw tourists from afar. I haven’t visited it much lately. Every time I have, though, it’s been so crowded, whereas it was once a place I went to to escape those very crowds. The once-derelict army quarters and forts have been renovated, open to the public as exhibitions and installations. While large swathes of the land used to be off-limits and under construction, they now stand proud as artificial fields with long, winding pathways for cyclists or pedestrians to amble alongside the water’s edge. It’s not the way I remember it.</p>
          <p>No, the way I remember it, it’s different. The crowds which visit it now are gone. When I arrive on the ferry and step off, there is no rush of people, only a small crowd that dissipates quickly and spreads out around the grounds. It feels more isolated, more intimate when I explore the island with my dad.</p>
          <p>The grounds are largely untouched, still lying dormant the way they have been since the mid-nineties. The fields, surrounded by the old brick fort walls, are overgrown, long tendrils of weeds licking my ankles as I stomp around. The army quarters are empty, abandoned. I can’t go inside them, so instead I press my face against the glass, as though trying to phase through to get a closer look at the interior. Nothing interesting lies there, though, only dead flies and dusty curtains which hang limply on the walls like wilted leaves. Even so, my insatiable curiosity overwhelms me, threatens to eat me alive. I don’t know what’s in the old buildings, and I desperately want to find out.</p>
          <p>The rest of the island is much the same. Large parts are off-limits, covered in scaffolding, yellow signs screaming “DO NOT ENTER.” Their warnings fall upon deaf ears, though– these aren’t doors that can be locked. To me they look like challenges, teetering jungle gyms begging to be climbed. My dad agrees. We clamber over the metal pipes, slinging ourselves over tops of brick walls and shuffling along the edges of window sills like silent-film slapstick protagonists. Beyond the plastic netting and chain-link fences, a whole world lies there, inviting us to explore it and make it our own.</p>
          <p>And we do. At one point we discover an apple tree pressed up in the corner of a brick wall, its branches heavy with ripe green fruit begging to be picked. Many of the apples lie on the grass below, picked apart by animals– rotting, wasted opportunities hidden away from the world. We’d found the rest of them, though. We stuff as many of the apples as we can into my dad’s bag, and I carry some in my t-shirt, flipped up to make a pouch. When we taste one, it’s delicious– the product of a fruitful tree, able to provide food for many, but unseen in a secluded corner of an abandoned army grounds. Its potential is unrecognized, but not by us. Every time we visit after that, we take as many of the apples as we can. It’s our secret, our (free!) souvenir from the obscure landmark in the middle of the New York Bay.</p>
          <p>The apple tree is no longer there. The part of the island it was on was renovated, no longer off-limits to the public. The areas my dad and I used to explore are still there, but they’re different. Visiting them is no longer an adventure, an exploration. Now it’s just a tour of a New York landmark. The army quarters have been fixed up too, turned into exhibitions for those curious enough to go inside. I was curious enough, once. But they no longer have the same mystery to them-- my fascination no longer eats at me and begs me to break in and explore. The island used to be our secret, a little-known landmark to visit during the summers. It’s not even summer-only anymore! It’s now open year-round, able to be visited by anyone anytime.</p>
          <p>I suppose these are all good things. The construction projects paid off. The newfound popularity and new exhibits surely bring in much more revenue, which in turn allows the island to continue on, continue to improve itself. But perhaps I’m selfish. I no longer love the island like I once did, because it’s not the same island anymore. While it once was my secret, my own personal escape, it’s now loved by many. I want it back the way it was, I want it for myself. I preferred it when it was rundown and decrepit, in desperate need of renovation. But it’s changed. And aside from getting older, I guess I… haven’t. Maybe I should.</p>
